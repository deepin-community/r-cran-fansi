#' Identify Unhandled ANSI Control Sequences
#'
#' Will return position and types of unhandled _Control Sequences_ in a
#' character vector.  Unhandled sequences may cause `fansi` to interpret strings
#' in a way different to your display.  See [fansi] for details.
#'
#' This is a debugging function that is not optimized for speed.
#'
#' The return value is a data frame with five columns:
#'
#' * index: integer the index in `x` with the unhandled sequence
#' * start: integer the start position of the sequence (in characters)
#' * stop: integer the end of the sequence (in characters), but note that if
#'   there are multiple ESC sequences abutting each other they will all be
#'   treated as one, even if some of those sequences are valid.
#' * error: the reason why the sequence was not handled:
#'     * exceed-term-cap: contains color codes not supported by the terminal
#'       (see [term_cap_test]).  Bright colors with color codes in the 90-97 and
#'       100-107 range in terminals that do not support them are not considered
#'       errors, whereas 256 or truecolor codes in terminals that do not support
#'       them are.  This is because the latter are often misinterpreted by
#'       terminals that do not support them, whereas the former are typically
#'       silently ignored.
#'     * special: SGR substring contains uncommon characters in ":<=>".
#'     * unknown: SGR substring with a value that does not correspond to a known
#'       SGR code.
#'     * non-SGR: a non-SGR CSI sequence.
#'     * non-CSI: a non-CSI escape sequence, i.e. one where the ESC is
#'       followed by something other than "[".  Since we assume all non-CSI
#'       sequences are only 2 characters long include the ESC, this type of
#'       sequence is the most likely to cause problems as many are not actually
#'       two characters long.
#'     * malformed-CSI: a malformed CSI sequence.
#'     * malformed-ESC: a malformed ESC sequence (i.e. one not ending in
#'       0x40-0x7e).
#'     * C0: a "C0" control character (e.g. tab, bell, etc.).
#' * translated: whether the string was translated to UTF-8, might be helpful in
#'   odd cases were character offsets change depending on encoding.  You should
#'   only worry about this if you cannot tie out the `start`/`stop` values to
#'   the escape sequence shown.
#' * esc: character the unhandled escape sequence
#'
#' @note Non-ASCII strings are converted to UTF-8 encoding.
#' @export
#' @seealso [fansi] for details on how _Control Sequences_ are
#'   interpreted, particularly if you are getting unexpected results.
#' @param x character vector
#' @inheritParams substr_ctl
#' @return data frame with as many rows as there are unhandled escape
#'   sequences and columns containing useful information for debugging the
#'   problem.  See details.
