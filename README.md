Counterparts to R string manipulation functions that account for the
effects of ANSI text formatting control sequences.

Formatting Strings with Control Sequences
-----------------------------------------

Many terminals will recognize special sequences of characters in strings
and change display behavior as a result. For example, on my terminal the
sequence `"\033[42m"` turns text background green:

![hello
world](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/rc/extra/images/hello.png)

The sequence itself is not shown, but the text display changes.

This type of sequence is called an ANSI CSI SGR control sequence. Most
\*nix terminals support them, and newer versions of Windows and Rstudio
consoles do too. You can check whether your display supports them by
running `term_cap_test()`.

Whether the `fansi` functions behave as expected depends on many
factors, including how your particular display handles Control
Sequences. See `?fansi` for details, particularly if you are getting
unexpected results.

Control Sequences Require Special Handling
------------------------------------------

ANSI control characters and sequences (*Control Sequences* hereafter)
break the relationship between byte/character position in a string and
display position.

For example, in `"Hello \033[42mWorld, Good\033[m Night Moon!"` the
space after “World,” is thirteenth displayed character, but the
eighteenth actual character (“\\033” is a single character, the ESC). If
we try to split the string after the space with `substr` things go wrong
in several ways:

![bad
substring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/master/extra/images/substr.png)

We end up cutting up our string in the middle of “World”, and worse the
formatting bleeds out of our string into the prompt line. Compare to
what happens when we use `substr_ctl`, the *Control Sequence* aware
version of `substr`:

![good
substring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/master/extra/images/substr_ctl.png)

Functions
---------

`fansi` provides counterparts to the following string functions:

-   `substr`
-   `strsplit`
-   `strtrim`
-   `strwrap`
-   `nchar` / `nzchar`

These are drop-in replacements that behave (almost) identically to the
base counterparts, except for the *Control Sequence* awareness.

`fansi` also includes improved versions of some of those functions, such
as `substr2_ctl` which allows for width based substrings. There are also
utility functions such as `strip_ctl` to remove *Control Sequences* and
`has_ctl` to detect whether strings contain them.

Most of `fansi` is written in C so you should find performance of the
`fansi` functions to be comparable to the base functions. `strwrap_ctl`
is much faster, and `strsplit_ctl` is somewhat slower than the
corresponding base functions.

HTML Translation
----------------

You can translate ANSI CSI SGR formatted strings into their HTML
counterparts with `sgr_to_html`:

Rmarkdown
---------

It is possible to set `knitr` hooks such that R output that contains
ANSI CSI SGR is automatically converted to the HTML formatted equivalent
and displayed as intended. See the
[vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/issue61/doc/sgr-in-rmd.html)
for details.

Installation
------------

This package is available on CRAN:

    install.packages('fansi')

It has no runtime dependencies.

For the development version use
`remotes::install_github('brodieg/fansi@development')` or:

    f.dl <- tempfile()
    f.uz <- tempfile()
    github.url <- 'https://github.com/brodieG/fansi/archive/development.zip'
    download.file(github.url, f.dl)
    unzip(f.dl, exdir=f.uz)
    install.packages(file.path(f.uz, 'fansi-development'), repos=NULL, type='source')
    unlink(c(f.dl, f.uz))

There is no guarantee that development versions are stable or even
working. The master branch typically mirrors CRAN and should be stable.
